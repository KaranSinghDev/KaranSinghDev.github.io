My name is Karan Singh, and I am a software engineer specializing in high-performance systems and scientific computing.

My journey into this field was born from a practical reality: while working on data-intensive projects, including contributions to the CERN software ecosystem, I repeatedly encountered the performance limits of general-purpose tools. This experience cultivated a deep-seated curiosity in the first principles of software performance. I became fascinated not just with *what* software does, but *how* it interacts with the underlying hardware to achieve speed, efficiency, and scale.

This curiosity drives my work. I focus on C++ and low-level systems design to build software that is not just correct, but also ruthlessly efficient. My approach is to understand problems from the metal up, whether that means designing a custom compression algorithm for a time-series database or optimizing a data reconstruction pipeline for a particle physics experiment.

My key projects reflect this passion:
*   **Insight-TSDB:** A time-series database I built from scratch in C++ to explore the internals of LSM-trees and high-throughput data ingestion.
*   **Distributed Caching System:** A fault-tolerant, clustered cache designed to handle high concurrency and ensure data integrity.
*   **GSoC at CERN-HSF:** An R&D project focused on benchmarking the energy consumption and performance of classical and quantum algorithms for scientific analysis.

I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems where every nanosecond and every byte matters. I am always looking to connect with others who are passionate about building the foundational software that powers science and technology.
